## For training
We need a pretrained backbone as a good initial weight when training on STF dataset. Save it in `backbone/`.
- `Convnext pretrained model`

## For testing:
Download the model weight of MT-DETR and compared baseline to validate the performance. Save them in `model/`.
- `Camera_only`
- `MT-DETR_c+l+r`
- `MT-DETR_c+l+r+t`
